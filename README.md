# Pure-Math-Club

This is the code behind the bot in the Discord server of University of Waterloo's pure math, applied math, combinatorics & optimization club. 

Note: if you want to clone this bot, there are a few files missing from this repository that you would have to add yourself. Namely, replace `secret` in `pmc.js` with your bot's token, and add a file named `settings.json` to store some settings.

The `settings.json` file should contain an empty array.
